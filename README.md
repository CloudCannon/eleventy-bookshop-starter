A starter template for a new Eleventy site using [Bookshop](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop)

To run locally:
```bash
npm i
npm start
```

This will serve the website on the default eleventy port, where components can be browsed in the bookshop renderer at /components.

To create a new component, run `npx @bookshop/init --component <name>`

This template should work out-of-the-box with live editing on CloudCannon.

To learn more, read the [Bookshop Eleventy Guide](https://github.com/CloudCannon/bookshop/blob/main/guides/eleventy.adoc).
